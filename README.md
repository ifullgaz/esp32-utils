esp32-utils
============

esp32-utils is a collection of utilities I found useful whilst
developing for the ESP32.
It can be dropped as is as a component in an ESP-IDF project.

Installation
------------

Extract or clone the module directly into the components directory of your project

```git clone https://github.com/ifullgaz/esp32-utils```

Test
----

The test can be ran from the command line as a normal ESP-IDF project.
Simply run ```make flash``` to run on a connected esp32 board.

Usage
-----

Please look at the test source file for an example. (TODO)
